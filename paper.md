# Summary

This Excel Macro takes XML-formatted citation output from EBSCOHost, and extracts certain elements into the worksheet. It is used to create a neat table of citations - for example, for a systematic literature review. The input is the location of the XML file that is obtained from EBSCOHost. The output is 6 columns: Record Number, Author (Year), Year, Title, Type of Publication, and hyperlinked DOI link. For Author (Year), there are various format depending on the number of authors (1, 2, 3+) on the reference.
